# Algorithms Practice Using Javascript

This repo is intended to serve as practice for interview questions and learning data structures manipulation.

I use different sources for algorithms problems. My sole intention is to practice algorithms and improve problem solving techniques. 

* [Regular Algorithms Problems](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) for Markdown parsing
 * [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) for the awesome syntax-highlighted editor
 * [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/) for syntax highlighting in output code blocks
 * [js-deflate](https:/
```
